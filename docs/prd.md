# Project STONESOUP: Strategic Vision & Product Brief

## 1. The Vision: What is STONESOUP?

Imagine your community is a vast library of expertise, but all the books are unmarked and unshelved. Project STONESOUP is the intelligent librarian that reads every book, understands its contents, and helps you find the exact piece of knowledge you need, instantly.

At its heart, STONESOUP is a smart platform that transforms scattered information—like news articles, interview transcripts, and social media posts—into rich, searchable, narrative-driven profiles of your community members.

Each client's implementation, called a "Cauldron," is tuned to focus on what matters most to them, ensuring the insights it generates are always relevant and valuable.

## 2. The Problem We Solve

Valuable expertise within communities remains locked away. Community managers spend hours on manual research, information quickly becomes stale, and priceless opportunities for connection and collaboration are missed every day. STONESOUP is designed to solve this by creating a living, intelligent repository of community knowledge that is always up-to-date.

## 3. The Core Experience: A Day in the Life

Our primary user, Sarah the Community Manager, starts her day needing to find members with experience in "sustainable manufacturing" for an upcoming panel.

Instead of digging through spreadsheets, she opens the STONESOUP "Ask or Browse" workspace and simply types her request. Instantly, the platform returns a set of profile cards for members who match her query. Each card features a 3-bullet, AI-generated summary of the person's relevant experience, complete with confidence scores and links to the source material.

Sarah can see that Elena Rodriguez has "pioneered a partnership with a local trade school for custom manufacturing training." This is perfect. She clicks "Explore Narrative" to read the full story, adds Elena to a list for the event, and clicks a "Watch" (⭐) icon to receive email updates if any new stories about Elena's work in manufacturing appear.

In five minutes, she has accomplished what used to take five hours.

## 4. How It Works: The Magic Behind the Curtain

STONESOUP's intelligence comes from its Automated Story Pipeline. Here's how it works in simple terms:

**We Feed the Cauldron:** We provide the system with raw information, like the transcript from a recent webinar.

**The AI Reads & Understands:** The system's AI, guided by the Cauldron's specific "Global Guidance Prompt" (e.g., "focus on workforce development and AI adoption"), reads the transcript. It identifies who was speaking, what key topics were discussed, and what the most important takeaways were.

**A Story is Born:** The AI then generates a structured "story" document, complete with a headline, a concise summary, and links to the participants. This story is then automatically added to the relevant members' profiles.

This process runs continuously, ensuring that the STONESOUP library is always growing and profiles are always current.

## 5. Key Features & Capabilities

### For Now (The Initial Launch)

- **Intelligent "Ask or Browse" Workspace:** A single, intuitive interface for both natural language search and filtered browsing.
- **Automated Story Generation:** The AI-powered pipeline that turns raw data into structured, searchable stories.
- **Cauldron Configuration:** The ability for administrators to "tune" their instance of STONESOUP to focus on the themes and topics that matter most to their community.
- **Community Curation Tools:** Simple tools like "Flag for Review" and "Watch Profile" that empower users to help maintain data quality and stay engaged.

### For Later (Future Possibilities)

- **Dynamic AI-Generated Imagery:** Imagine each profile card having a unique, beautiful header image generated by AI based on the person's skills and stories—a visual representation of their expertise.
- **Proactive Opportunity Matching:** The system could actively alert community managers, saying, "A new member just joined who is a perfect fit for the 'sustainable manufacturing' panel you're planning."
- **Advanced User-Facing Tools:** Allowing community members to suggest edits or add new stories to their own profiles, further enriching the "stone soup."

## 6. Our Guiding Principles

This project is built on a foundation of core values that ensure we create a tool that is not only powerful but also responsible, reliable, and respectful of its users.

- **Plan the Work, Work the Plan:** We are guided by a clear, shared strategy.
- **Don't Trust AI Blindly:** Human oversight and quality assurance are at the core of our system.
- **Explain the 'Why':** Our code and our AI will be transparent, not a black box.
- **One Source of Truth:** We maintain a single, canonical source for our data to ensure integrity.
- **Build for Everyone:** We are committed to accessibility, ensuring our tool can be used by all.
- **Respect Privacy by Design:** Protecting user data is an architectural decision, not an afterthought.
