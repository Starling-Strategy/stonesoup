## üß† AI Embeddings

### What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They enable "smart search" that finds relevant content based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

**Example**: Searching for "restaurant management" will find stories about:
- Food service operations
- Kitchen workflow optimization
- Staff training in hospitality
- Customer experience design

### How STONESOUP Uses Embeddings

1. **Member Profile Embeddings**: Generated from combined bio, skills, expertise, and experience
2. **Story Embeddings**: Created from title, content, summary, and demonstrated skills
3. **Semantic Search**: Find similar members or content using cosine similarity
4. **Content Recommendations**: Suggest relevant stories based on member interests
5. **Skill Matching**: Connect members with complementary expertise

### Technical Details
- **Model**: OpenRouter's `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dimensions)
- **Provider**: OpenAI via OpenRouter API
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Search Method**: Cosine similarity for finding related content

## üöÄ Running the Seed Script

### Prerequisites

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Ensure PostgreSQL is running with pgvector extension
   psql -d your_database -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required for embedding generation
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
   
   # Optional: Custom database URL
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/stonesoup"
   ```

3. **Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Full seeding with embeddings (recommended)
python seed_database.py --clear-existing --verbose

# Quick seeding without embeddings (for development)
python seed_database.py --skip-embeddings --verbose

# Custom cauldron name
python seed_database.py --cauldron-name "My Demo Workspace"
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--clear-existing` | Remove existing data before seeding |
| `--skip-embeddings` | Skip embedding generation (faster, no semantic search) |
| `--cauldron-name` | Name for the demo workspace (default: "10KSB Demo") |
| `--verbose` | Enable detailed logging |
| `--help` | Show help message |

## üîç Testing Semantic Search

After seeding, you can test the semantic search capabilities:

### Example Searches

1. **"restaurant operations"** - Finds Elena's stories about food service management
2. **"technology startups"** - Discovers Marcus's tech entrepreneurship experiences  
3. **"sustainable manufacturing"** - Locates Sarah's environmental business practices
4. **"crisis management"** - Surfaces COVID-19 pivot stories across multiple members
5. **"team leadership"** - Finds stories about staff management and development

### Search Quality Indicators

Good semantic search results should:
- Find relevant content even without exact keyword matches
- Surface stories from multiple members with similar themes
- Rank results by relevance (similarity score)
- Include diverse story types (achievements, case studies, experiences)

## üõ† Development Usage

### For Backend Development
```python
# Access seed data programmatically
from seed_data.sample_members import generate_member_profiles
from seed_data.sample_stories import get_all_sample_stories

members = generate_member_profiles()
stories = get_all_sample_stories("your-cauldron-id")
```

### For Testing
```python
# Test with specific member data
from seed_data.sample_members import get_member_by_email

elena = get_member_by_email("elena.rodriguez@micocina.com")
marcus = get_member_by_email("marcus@techsolutions.co")
```

### For Embedding Development
```python
# Generate custom embeddings
from seed_data.embedding_generator import EmbeddingGenerator

generator = EmbeddingGenerator()
embedding = await generator.generate_embedding("your text here")
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Members
1. Edit `seed_data/sample_members.py`
2. Add new member dictionaries to the `generate_member_profiles()` function
3. Include realistic business details and skills

### Adding New Stories
1. Edit `seed_data/sample_stories.py`
2. Add story templates or specific stories for members
3. Ensure stories include proper metadata (tags, skills, etc.)

### Modifying Embeddings
1. Edit `seed_data/embedding_generator.py`
2. Adjust text preparation logic for better semantic representation
3. Modify embedding model or parameters

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenRouter API key not found"**
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

**"pgvector extension not installed"**
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

**"Database connection failed"**
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify connection credentials

**"Embedding generation slow"**
- Use `--skip-embeddings` for faster development
- Check internet connection for API calls
- Consider caching with local development

### Performance Tips

1. **Use Caching**: Embeddings are cached locally to avoid regeneration
2. **Skip Embeddings**: Use `--skip-embeddings` during development
3. **Batch Processing**: The script automatically batches API calls
4. **Clean Existing**: Use `--clear-existing` to avoid duplicates

## üìù Logging

The script generates detailed logs:
- **Console Output**: Real-time progress and status
- **Log File**: `seed_database.log` with full details
- **Summary Report**: JSON report with statistics
